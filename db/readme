  - file_permissions' cosmic twin
  - str: a magical scroll capturing the essence of a comment

🔮 file_permissions - A realm of mystical access keys
  - query: create table file_permissions (id integer primary key autoincrement, file integer not null, user integer not null, permission text not null, foreign key (file) references files(id), foreign key (user) references users(id));
  - file: the sacred tome's id, guiding us through the labyrinth of files
